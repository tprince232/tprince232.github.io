I will use this blog to post reflections related to various topics discussed in my [Computer Science Ethics course][course-site].

I built the blog using [jekyll][jekyll-organization] and the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) template.

For more information about me, check out my home page [here](https://www3.nd.edu/~tprince).

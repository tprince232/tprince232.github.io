I do not know if it is really possible to "have it all."  In a literal sense "have it all" means that you have everything you want and are perfectly content.  I think that we must acknowledge that life will have to have tradeoffs at times.  Focusing on having it all will lead to unnecessary discontentment.  If you want to have it all you may always want something that's better than where you are at.  

This may sound like a depressing take, but I think that by achieving a satisfactory work-life balance, you don't need to have it all.  Sometimes you may need to sacrifice a career opportunity.  Sometimes you may unfortunately miss your child's baseball games.   I plan to have a family and I think that caring for and spending time with my spouse and children is incredibly important.  Some sacrifices may need to be made on this end for career development, but I do not believe in making a career decision that would take away from these relationships in a significant way.  It's all about a balance. When it comes to myself, I hope that my happiness will derive from my family and my career.  Having time to remain physically healthy is a top priority as well.  Hobbies and desires beyond these things are a plus, but personal hobbies and desires can be sacrificed.  After all, we can't literally have it all.

I burned-out of swimming in high school.  My rigorous high school curriculum and getting into my dream school were my priorities in high school.  I was also on a club swim team and my high school swim team, practice for my club team was mostly year-round and six days a week, two to two-and-a-half hours a day, with extra practices some mornings before school as well as after.  It was not worth it anymore.  I didn't want to swim in college anymore.  I didn't know why I kept doing it.  I wanted to play volleyball with my friends after school, or grab half-price-apps at Applebee's, or go skiing in Vermont with my family. But I couldn't. I didn't have a balance.  So I made the hard decision of quitting my club team at the start of my senior year.  I just did high school swimming, which required less hours, and was for only three months. I absolutely enjoyed my senior year of high school because of this decisions.

I felt kind of like a quitter.  I felt like I was giving up on something, like I was becoming "weak" mentally because I did not want to go to practice anymore.  I can completely understand why those who know they work too hard and no longer enjoy their work do not feel like they can slow down.  

The stress from swimming was not entirely bad.  It kept me focused on my other activities.  It put me on a schedule.  But it got to a point where it was unhealthy stress.  Unfortunately, I think I did lose the phenomenal work ethic and time management skills that I had in high school because I stopped swimming.  

I think that it is great for companies to recognize that their employees owe them work from 9:00-5:00, and not outside of those hours.  However, if a person decides to work for a startup up or a different high intensity job, they should be prepared for what they are signing up for.

Avanade is a strong proponent of a healthy work-life balance.  On top of salaries, Avanade pays employees a stipend that can be used to cultivate their health and their hobbies. Avanade was constantly hosting social events and happy hours after work for all to partake.  Work-at-home is permissible, especially during holiday seasons.  As a consulting firm, Avanade does require employees to travel during the week if the client is not local; however, the company is working to expand regional offices to limit the number of consultants that need to travel.  I do not foresee myself traveling during my first several years at Avanade.  Other companies can do things like this to help promote the work-life balance of their employees.

I would have been prepared to work at a more intense setting, but the work life balance at Avanade was a huge plus.

If I am overworked while in my early twenties, I do not think it is the worst thing ever.  I certainly do not want to be *too* overworked.  But when I approach my thirties, life will have to take a larger role if it doesn't have a large role already.  If familial relationships are hurting (or I cannot start a family because work is stopping me from finding a wife), something will need to change.  If I am unhealthy, something will need to change.  On the other hand, if I am missing work or arriving late too often because of familial duties, something will need to change.  

Ensuring I continue to love my job is a priority for avoiding burnout.  

Again, I can't stress if everything is not perfect.  I need to accept that compromises will need to be made.

My group created [this guide][guide-link] for getting a job after graduating from Notre Dame.

I think the most important part of it is the idea of starting to prepare early.  And not preparing specifically for an interview or a given job but preparing by immersing yourself in the industry.  This includes reading articles and talking to people as well as going above and beyond for in class projects.  This creates a great sense of authenticity and depth when you are actually interviewing.  You do not need to think "What project can I spin to be interesting when I get asked to talk about a project?" because you should have a plethora of projects that you were passionate about.   Getting an "A" in a class is great but loving what you are working on because you have engaged yourself is much better.

I think the best advice I ever received is advice that alieved the pressure given by the "imposter syndrome."  You should not be afraid that you do not know anything because so many people are in the same shoes as you, feeling like imposters.  The imposter syndrome is also a symptom of knowingly trying to "fake it."  If you heed the advice I gave in the preceding paragraph, you have no reason to feel like you are faking it.  

I wish I knew that the process does not have to be terrible or stressful.  I think you just need to learn to enjoy it.  Enjoy talking to people in the industry, enjoy your projects, enjoy learning about companies and everything.  Then it all comes together.  And I think true passion and enjoyment really shows in interviews. 

The claim that "College traditionally has been viewed as a place of learning, not necessarily job training" is somewhat debatable, since so many degrees have the implication that they are gearing you for a certain profession.  I don't think many pre-med majors study pre-med without the intention of going to medical school and becoming a doctor.  I think that it is valid to say that college is meant to make you prepared to be a professional in a given field.

That being said, I understand the sentiment that college is place to *learn*.  Curriculums should focus on how to be very good at a job, not how to be good at *getting* a job.  Students do not all have the same goals in mind so many students might not like the idea that they need to get a certain tech job being pushed on them all of the time (as was shared by some of my classmates).  But there are also people who really want to get a job and would like to see more direct interview preparation from the department.

I think electives that will make students better interview candidates would be really helpful because those who are preparing for interviews can take these classes.  While I did not take the class, Dr. Bui's "Programming Challenges" course seems like a good example of this.   I also took the Case Studies in Computing Based Entrepreneurship course, and while it was focused on entrepreneurship it was very great for leaning about the field as a whole in a not very technical way.  More projects in classes could help students get more project experience and could lead to better behavioral interviews.  Maybe a full three-credit project heavy course that incorporates responses to behavioral questions about the how the projects went would be really good.

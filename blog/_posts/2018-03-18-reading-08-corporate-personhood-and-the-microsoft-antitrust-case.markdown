Corporate Personhood refers to the idea that corporations, which are defined as a united body of people serving a purpose, can be related to individuals and be endowed with the same rights.  

In the United States, Corporate Personhood became more clearly defined in a legal sense after the Southern Pacific Railroad company appealed to the 14th Amendment after the Civil War.  The railroad company claimed that just as the 14th Amendment guarantees people equal protection under the law, corporations do too, and therefore Santa Clara County could not tax the railroad for their fencing.  The court ruled on the side Southern Pacific Railroad.  Corporations continued to win such rights and gained protection against search and seizure as well as the rights to due process, however corporations could not plead the 5th. 

Corporations gained even more human attributes when Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission determined in 2010 that corporations can donate in federal elections and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores determined in 2014 that for-profit corporations can have a religion. 

Corporations can be convicted of crimes and pay ramifications, but because it does not have a physical body a corporation cannot be incarcerated.  A corporation’s actions are made of the actions of the individuals within it.

This makes things complicated.  We have a blurry area of what rights corporations do and do not have.  We also have a blurry area as to who is responsible for the crimes of a corporation.  The corporations? An individual? Individuals? Which ones?

The ability for corporations to have political intentions and influence in elections, as well as ideologies, also complicates things.  Companies can spend money to fuel legislation that is in their best interest.  People can too, but companies have a greater spending power and might be considered to be less likely to have the public good in their best interest.  

People are legally bound to behave legally but are not legally bound to behave morally.  Arguably, what is required by the law and what is required by morality tend to overlap well, at least on an individual level.  If corporations are going to be considered people, this would imply we should want laws specific to corporations that will force companies in a more moral direction.  The problem is, it is difficult in many cases to determine what is personally moral in a situation, and it is even more difficult to do this with corporations.

Antitrust laws in the United States are made to protect consumers from companies, and this manifests itself through laws that promote fair competition between competitors.

In 2000 Microsoft was accused of blocking Netscape from the internet browser market by closely tying Internet Explorer to its Windows operating system which at the time had the vast majority of the market share.  The lawsuit claimed that the preinstalled Internet Explorer confused or made it difficult for users to use other browsers.
My initial thought is that it is pretty absurd because today users can just change the default browser.  But after more thought I realize how different things were back then.  If I remember right almost every application had to be installed with a disk back then, and the installing process was not simple.  That makes me understand better how this was more limiting

I think it is hard to say if what Microsoft did was unethical.  I go back and forth a little about the principle.  I believe Microsoft should in theory be able to push their own browser on their own operating system.  They built their operating system after all.  However, I do agree the competition is very healthy.  If it weren’t for the actions taken against Microsoft, we might not have a variety of really good browsers as we do today.  

The other thing is that this integration is everywhere today, and in many cases, it enhances products. Mac’s were and are very integrated with other Apple applications.  I suppose this is arguably different because Macs do not take up a majority of the PC market (but maybe iPhones taking up a majority of the smartphone market pushes Mac purchases), and it is also different because Windows was selling an operating system while Apple is selling entire PCs.   

Today we also see Google, Amazon, and Facebook creating vertical and horizontal monopolies in similar manners to Microsoft.  With this in mind I look at the Microsoft case differently. It was more about setting a precedent than it was about exactly what Microsoft was doing.  And I think the Microsoft integration ideology has won out over time.  I think we are more accepting of the scale of these companies because in 2000, Microsoft was by far the leader in the industry, but now we have a variety of companies with some overlap and some specialties.

I think breaking up Microsoft would have been too harsh.  But forcing them to have more competitor friendly practices was probably for the best.  I just think it is really tricky to draw the line on what is ethical and unethical when utilizing a monopoly and prowess in a field to further expand your services.

I do agree that companies should have ethical and moral standards just like people, especially if they are going to be treated like people in the eyes of the law.  But as I mentioned above, it is hard to determine what is moral for individuals, let alone companies.  Therefore, it is really difficult to make effective laws that are enforceable with regard to corporations.  Just because these laws are hard to design does not mean that they should not exist.   This is why we have trials and juries.  In the Microsoft case, at the very least the company was accidentally doing something that was wrong, and the case was debated for a long time until what was close to the correct outcome was reached.

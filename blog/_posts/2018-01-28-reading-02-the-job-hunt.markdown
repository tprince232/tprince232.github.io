I am fortunate that my "Job Hunt," as the search for post-graduation employment is called at Notre Dame, worked out well for me, despite many failures along the way and up to the end.

During my junior year I was focused on getting an internship for the upcoming summer.  After a number of online assessments and phone screens and a few onsite interviews with various companies, I received an offer from [Avanade, Inc.][avanade] as a solutions developer in the company's Chicago Digital Studio.  Because this blog is public, I prefer not to go into details of the hiring process with Avanade to preserve confidentiality.  

I enjoyed my internship and learned a lot, and received an offer to return full time after the internship had ended and before the school year had begun.  I felt compelled to accept because of the relationships I built and because of how I earned from Avanade as a result of the experience.  However, I decided I would wait until my accept date in early October to make a final decision.

I wanted to apply to work at a big West Coast tech company.  Part of it was I wanted to challenge myself.  I wanted to see what I can do and viewed getting hired by one of the "Big Five" to be an accomplishment in itself, a testament of my coding abilities and technical knowledge.  And I was also drawn to the impact I could have at one of the companies.  People around the world benefit from the tools coming out of Silicon Valley and Seattle.  And I would be lying to say the salaries did not influence my decision to apply as well.

I will not name the companies I interviewed for, because this blog is public, and by not naming them I think I is safe for me to discuss in some detail what the processes were like.  I applied to two companies, and after a few online or phone interviews at each, I made it to the onsite final round at each company.  At the end of the day, I did not get an offer from either company and was more than content accepting my return offer with Avanade.

Last week, I praised these processes for upholding meritocratic ideals.  They tested me on whiteboard programming skills and my technical knowledge.  They also asked behavioral questions which are arguably less objective and more subjective.  One company had me on three forty-five-minute interviews with a break between each, and another company had me on four of these interviews.  They began with behavioral questions, then a few about general technical knowledge, then the whiteboard.  As I read this week's articles about the hiring process, I noticed that many observations and criticism were very true.  This made me rethink I how highly I esteemed the big tech company recruiting process in my reflection last week.

When I did not receive an offer, I accepted that I was not the best candidate.  I stumbled a few times at the whiteboard and when I reflected on my answers to behavioral questions I noticed instances where I did not showcase myself as well as I could have.   I accepted that I did not merit the job and others did.  They were four for four on the whiteboard, I was three for four.

I could take the perspective that these problems were not really reflective of my true skills and abilities as a programmer, and I deserved the job more than someone who got it.  And that really might be true, but to me it's not worthwhile to look at it that way.  ["We Hire the Best, Just Like Everyone Else"][hire-best] nailed the reason why this happens. Companies believe that, "It is better to reject a good applicant every single time than accidentally accept one single mediocre applicant."  I had made a groupme chat with some of the other people I interviewed with at one of the companies, and not a single one of us in the groupme me got the job.  And it was not entirely surprising.  These companies pull talent through them like livestock at an industrial farm.  There were twenty interviewees in the morning alone, twenty again in the afternoon.  They really can hire *the best*.

The best by the metrics that they choose to evaluate on.  You can argue that these are not the right metrics.  Quincy Larson is very critical of whiteboard programming in ["Why is hiring broken? It starts at the whiteboard"][whiteboard], saying that it does not appropriately evaluate how good a candidate actually is.  A better metric, for example, would be how much a candidate has contributed to open source.  Another criticism is that candidates who are not college graduates simply do not have time outside of their normal work hours to slave over preparing for whiteboard type questions.   

The most surprising thing was the number of candidates brought in, and the number from that that do not get offers.  

The most frustrating thing was not getting an offer after my onsite interviews.  Not knowing exactly why.  Wishing I said something else or tackled a problem in a different way.  

I was excited to see the company's campuses.  I was excited about the challenge. I was excited to learn what goes on behind the products we use every day.

From a results perspective, it appears this is effective, despite not being entirely efficient.  Tech companies are taking over the world, whether they are truly getting the best or not.  It's hard to say the process is efficient because these companies must spend a massive amount of money on flying and hoteling candidates they reject. But I suppose they found it is efficient to avoid false positives at the expense of many false negatives.

Its good that the whiteboard is a relatively objective way to measure all candidates on clear metrics.  But the way companies truck people through day in and day out like livestock, with the intent to hire just a few, evaluating on debatably irrelevant metrics: that's questionable.

I am Troy Prince and I am a senior at the University of Notre Dame.  My interests include swimming, skiing, traveling, and technology.  I am studying Computer Science because I found that there are so many opportunities for people with degrees in Computer Science to do so many different things.  I always enjoyed building things while growing up and I felt that learning how to program opens the door to build more things than any other major in the College of Engineering does, despite these things not being as “physical” as the products of other engineers.  Through this class, I hope to become engaged with the non-technical challenges that Computer Scientists face in industry.

I believe that the most pressing ethical and moral issues faced by Computer Scientists revolve around how technology is changing people's psychology and the way we live our lives in ways that can be detrimental in the long run.   In this [discussion][cp-video] with [Chamath Palihapitiya][chamath-palihapitiya]  and this [interview][sp-video]  with [Sean Parker][sean-parker], the former Facebook executives discuss long term ramifications of Facebook (and social media in general) on humanity.  A main focus of the videos is how Facebook’s goal was to keep users hooked on the site for as long as possible, which has led to social media addiction (another focus is on the misinformation epidemic that has flourished party because of social media).  The greater question, for me, is at what point are humans no longer using technology as a tool, and rather, the technology is using humans.  Programming is a powerful weapon and certainly can be misused.  This can be extended beyond social media. For example, one can argue the software that powers amazon.com manipulates people to purchase as many goods as possible and the software in video games keeps users playing for as long as possible.

In addition to this issue of manipulative software and software addiction, I am very interested in the issues related to privacy (particularly related to large tech companies using user data), corporate conscience, distruptive technologies, and intellectual property.

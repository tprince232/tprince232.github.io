Jesse Noller makes a great case for having codes of conduct in his article, ["The Code of Conduct"][code-of-conduct].  It's hard to argue with the fact some level of written rules need to exist.  Furthermore, you cannot pretend that workplaces are incident free and the rules are a nuisance.  

United States law does contain anti-workplace discrimination laws.  Trust me, I had to take a several hour-long online course to become well versed in them as part of onboarding during my internship.  Do we need another set of rules?  I think so.  Companies can make codes of conduct that are geared towards their specific values and cultures.  What is described in the law is pretty vague because it must fit every company.  Different states have different codes for whatever bureaucratic reasons.  Is something ethical in one state and not another? No.  Do codes mean that something is ethical at one company but not another.  No as wellâ€¦ however a company can be verbose about its stance on behaviors beyond what is discussed in the law.

The issue comes when these company-specific codes are being created and being enforced and applied to a variety of situations.

When I was sampling the codes of conduct provided in the readings ([1][code-1], [2][code-2], [3][code-3]) some rules seemed out of place.  The first codes just listed traits that were generally good to have, for example "Be friendly", "Be careful in the words we choose", "Be considerate", and an interesting one, "Be patient."  I question if we really need a code of conduct to outline this.  But at the same time I agree we should be friendly, be careful what we say, and be considerate, etc.  They definitely foster a good culture.

I also do not think someone should become personally offended if someone is impatient with them.  The author of this [anti-political correctness article][anti-article] would agree.  Maybe if someone is lacking self-awareness in a respect its fair for them to receive behavior that is not friendly in order for them to get the hint.  The author discusses the political bias in these codes of conduct.  I think that a good code of conduct can and should separate things that are clearly discrimination from discussion of political issues and disallow the discriminatory behaviors but allow for opposing political discourse.  

This is also a hard task to do, as became evident in the Google Memo scandal.  [Sundar Pichai's response][response-article] to the memo was interesting to read.  The CEO says that the debate in the memo was not the issue, but it was the stereotypes on gender discussed in memo. I do not think that James Damore had malicious intent when he discussed these things.  I think Google did have the right to fire him if they saw what he said as discriminatory and harmful to the company's culture.

I think Dunbar had to have been knowing he was doing something risky when circulating a memo that he knows would make a lot of people very mad at him or legitimately hurt by what he had to say.  Maybe he should have approached HR to see what he was allowed to say in such a memo? Companies could have resources to discuss what can and cannot be said to avoid situations like this.

I think politics is too prevalent in too many parts of our lives already, so I plan to separate politics from the workplace.  But I am not sure if it will be entirely possible, especially if the ethically of a business decision is dependent on a political stance, and because politics tend to come up pretty often in conversations these days.

The ethos of the computing industry is that the field is an egalitarian meritocracy serving to change the world for the better.

The industry manifests its meritocratic ideals by claiming that those who succeed in the industry do so solely through their ability to create the best code, resulting in the best products, resulting in success.  I agree with Timothy Lee's sentiments in [The Capitol of Meritocracy is Silicon Valley, Not Wall Street][article-1] that Silicon Valley is far more meritocratic than Wall Street and admissions at prestigious universities.  The computing industry is usually hiring solely based upon one's ability to code well.  In other areas, there is far more subjectivity.  

While I cannot vouch for every company in technology, my interview experiences with two West Coast flagship companies reflected this (with an exception).  I was evaluated based on my ability to solve coding challenges and on my knowledge of software systems and concepts.  I had a "connection" at one of the companies, which may have proved more valuable at a company that values connections.  My friend's older brother has worked at the company for four years.  When I asked if I should send my recruiters a follow up thank you email, he laughed and said, "That's not necessary, they do not care about your social skills at all here."  I was not being judged on who I was, but on what I knew and what I could do.

The exception to meritocratic ideals at established companies (compared to startups) is that Software Engineering contains human factors (as I discussed in my Reading 00 post) and this means hiring cannot be entirely objective.  During by big-tech company interview, I was asked questions about team project dynamics and processes that I have participated in.  This allows for bias in hiring on how one might act in a team and as an employee compared to hiring solely based on their technical and critical thinking abilities.

Meritocratic ideals also fall through in the realm of startups and entrepreneurship.  Perhaps because making a company is far less dependent on coding skills and far more dependent to luck and the business principles of other industries.  Alice Marwick in very critical of the tech industry's claims to be a meritocracy in ["Silicon Valley isn't a Meritocracy. And It's Dangerous to Hero-Worship Entrepreneurship"][article-2], and most of her criticism are in the area of entrepreneurship.  For example, the startup industry of Silicon Valley is founded on male leaning values of competition and ambition, according in Marwick, therefore it cannot be called a meritocracy.  This is troubling for me because I am excited by the risk-taking, competitive aspects of startup culture, but it means that you also cannot call the technology industry a pure meritocracy, which I also value.  

As with all things in life, the industry also does not entirely level the playing field between the rich and the poor (those who grew up with computers vs. those who would have had to go to the library to use one, for example), again putting a hole in claims that the industry is purely meritocratic.  

Thus the industry in many ways upholds meritocratic ideals, but one must acknowledge it falls short in some areas.  

The second part of my initial statement about the computing industry's ethos is that the industry is serving to change the world for the better. In many ways it is. Life has arguably become more productive, efficient, and easier due to what has come from the computing industry.  I value this a lot.  However, criticism can be drawn against these claims, saying the tech industry is not truly focused on the world's deepest problems, like climate change and poverty.  While working, I plan to always evaluate the what the true impact of what I am doing is on society and then change my specific line of work if I feel I am not having as much of an impact as I believe my work should have.

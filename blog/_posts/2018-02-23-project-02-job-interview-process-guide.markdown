**When should students start preparing or planning for internship or job interviews?**

It’s never too early to start preparing for post graduation career goals, but it can end up being too late.  The time to start getting serious about preparing for interviews is also dependent on what these goals are.  

Regardless what you want to do, starting as a freshman you should be engaged in what you are studying and planning to study in a way that has your goals in mind.  Too many people “go through the motions” of just getting the grades they need to get without considering how their work might be useful in an industry.  Speaking to other people (like upperclassmen) about the field and reading articles about the field are great ways to more fully understand what you are going into.  This creates a sense of depth when it comes time to seriously interview.

Companies love to ask about projects.  Behavioral interviews are founded on asing about different things you have worked on inside and outside of class.  Making your projects you do for class be projects that you would want to talk about in an interview is very helpful when it actually comes time to talk about these projects.  This might mean doing more than going than just going through the motions to get an “A”.  It means choosing projects that you will be passionate about seeing done very well.  Doing projects outside of class looks even better, cause it shows true initiative and passion for technology.

Doing these things prepares you for interviews without actively thinking about the interview.  And these things are done well before an interview happens.  But it is the difference between needing to prepare heavily before an interview and already being prepared before you even get an interview. 

An internship after freshman year would be great but is unnecessary, an internship after sophomore year would be a huge plus, and an internship after junior year is pretty imperative.  Companies want to see people that have experience, and it adds to your ethos if you have been employed before.  Also, you might love your internship work, get hired back, and have a stress-free senior year in terms of job searching.  An internship can also be substituted with research or some other work that is preparing you for a career.  I think it is very important to have this before senior year to show that you are engaged.  For earlier summers, however, if you have a summer job you love, or do not want to take an unpaid job, or want to study abroad, etc., I think that it is fine to do these things.

Right at the start of junior year would be my recommended time for starting to apply for internships for the coming summer.  Not getting serious about getting an internship until the next semester could be too late.  If you do not get an internship first semester junior year, that’s totally fine, at least you got tons of experience sending out applications and hopefully some interviews that will prepare you to get an internship the following semester.

Applications for post graduation employment at many companies end early in the fall of senior year.  The means you need to send out some applications as early as August.   And if you want a job at a large west coast company, you should get serious about preparing for the coming technical interviews as early as August.

Unfortunately, the grind never truly ends.  When you are employed, it’s still great to have the future in mind.

**How should students prepare or plan for these interviews?**

Students should prepare for an interview first by researching the company they are interviewing with. You would be surprised on how many candidates do not do their homework on the core business model of the place that they work at or know what current products and services the company provides. Taking the time to conduct this research indicates to the employer your level of investment in acquiring a job at their organization. In addition to this research if you have the name of the person conducting the interview you should look them up on LinkedIn or the company’s employee directory to examine their personal professional background. This way you can elaborate on similar experiences you had or ask them questions about what they enjoy in their particular business unit. 

The next key to preparation is to practice for the interview. It is crucial to try to anticipate the questions an company might ask. Websites like Glassdoor often have posts written by individuals who have interviewed with the company you are looking at. They normally include sample questions that range from standard behavioral queries to advanced technical or critical thinking questions that they like to ask. Once you create a test bank of questions write out your answers to them or practice answering them outloud to a friend or parent. Having a few answers in your back pocket helps build your confidence in the interview. 

The final key to prepping for the interview is to bring the necessary materials and wear the appropriate attire for it. Always bring extra copies of your resume regardless of whether you had to submit one in the application process. Bring your computer as well so they can examine technical projects that you have listed on your resume. With regards to attire make sure that you wear what is appropriate for the employer. It is never a bad thing to dress business professional but if the firm is a relaxed tech collective that is proud of their laid back nature then a business suit might not be appropriate.

**What resources should students consider? Books? Career Services? Student groups?**

The first resource that students should consider is the company’s website. Often they have whole pages of content dedicated to applicants. For example Booz Allen Hamilton has a whole page on their website dedicated to how to prepare for their interview. 
Other websites that can be helpful are Glassdoor and other message boards that can provide inside information on the types of questions that interviewer will likely ask. They also give useful information about salaries and benefits that company provides. This is useful when you are comparing companies side by side. 
Books can be helpful if they give tips on how to prepare for specialized types of interviews. Cracking the Code Interview is a common book that CSE majors have to prepare for the tricky data structures and algorithms problems that are asked in technical interviews. If you came across a book on Amazon that provided details on how to prepare for interviews about a certain industry that you want then it is probably in your best interest to buy it. Besides that I would say that you should avoid books on behavioral interviews. Behavioral interviews are judging interpersonal skills that you have built throughout your life and are not something you build in a couple days by reading a book. That being said it is crucial to have experiences that you can cite that showcase your ability to work with others. 

A visit to Career Services is helpful just to get pointers from professionals.  Follow Career Services guidelines for making a resume.  They probably will also give great behavioral interview advice.  But when it comes to technical specific questions (like whiteboard questions), Career Services is not very helpful.  Computer Science seniors, however, typically hold mock coding interview sessions and information sessions every fall.   To get industry specific advice, a great resource to talk to is a professor.

Student groups can be helpful in the job search process. Every student is going through or has been through similar processes. A good resource for CSE students is the Linux User Group. The members have a diverse experience in internships and have varied career goals. Chances are that one of the members has interviewed with a similar company or the same company. They also have insight into prepping for technical interviews. Another group that CSE students should consider is CSE service projects. This group has a plethora of experience using computer science to help the community and would have plenty of ideas for what you could do for a side project to build your resume.

**What extracurricular activities should students consider?**

Anything that shows particular interest in your chosen field or gives you the chance to show off your skillset.  Employers will be interested in team projects and any leadership positions you held.  But it’s key to actually participate in things you enjoy doing.  An extracurricular activity probably won’t guarantee you a job in most cases, so if you don’t enjoy something then it might be best to focus your time somewhere else.

**How can students take advantage of networking and alumni relationships?**

Make connections while at ND and also at your internships.  A good relationship with your supervisor and coworkers can help you get rehired later.  Additionally, finding fellow alums on LinkedIn will give you more connections to reach out to.  Many major cities have a Notre Dame alumni club which can help connect students with other alums and opportunities.

**How should students approach negotiations or contracts? Are there any pitfalls they should look out for?**

Students should air on the side of caution and respect when it comes to negotiations.  This is especially true if a student only has one option.  Not having the extra money you hoped to bargain for is much better than losing an offer for coming of poorly when negotiating an offer.  Multiple offers does allow for more leverage.

Try to understand what seems like it can be flexible and what might not.  A start date might be arbitrarily chosen and asking if it can be moved would do not harm.  

When it comes to deadlines for accepting an offer, you must be very careful.  Asking for a deadline extension implies that you are looking into other options.  I had a good experience with asking for a deadline extension. Transparency is key.  My recruiter was very impressed by the fact that I called her and explained my situation as opposed to sending hiding behind a brief email.

**Anything else you wish you knew before you went through the whole process!**

I wish I knew the importance of sending thank you notes or emails after interviews before the process began. I forgot to ask for the contact information of the interviewer once and I had to scramble to find it after my dad reminded me how important it was. - James 

Do not make the process a chore.  Make it an adventure.  People who interview you or who you network with at events are normal people too, not robots.  Doing projects doesn’t need to be a chore too if you do something you like.  Going to interviews is fun because you get to go to a new place and learn cool things about the company you are interviewing with. - Troy

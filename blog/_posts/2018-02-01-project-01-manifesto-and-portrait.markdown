This [link][google-doc] leads to a Google Doc where James Marvin and I created a Manifesto and Portrait of the Notre Dame Computer Science and Engineering student.

The Manifesto we created is a concise list of standards that ND CSE students hold themselves to and behaviors we perform or plan to perform.  Admittedly, some of the claims are bold.  For many of the claims, many students in the class including myself fall short at times.  However, I believe that it is an ideal list of statements that we should strive to fulfil, and it wholeheartedly reflects my thoughts and feelings.   

The last group of statements is somewhat of a war cry: "We strive to be as bold as Father Sorin was when he founded this great University.  We bear our university's name proudly and act in line with its mission.  Every action we do serves to fulfil God's mission for us and His creation."  I thought it was important to call upon the University's mission in the manifesto because we are after all *Notre Dame* Computer Scientist and Engineers and I think the values instilled in us through a Catholic education is part of what makes us really unique.  

I identify well with the portrait we created.  Our portrait captures the well-rounded nature of the class as a whole.  I am very aligned with the sense of community and togetherness that exists strongly within my computer science grade despite people having different interests and backgrounds.  My values also align with the general desire to make an impact on the world. 

I avoid using stereotypes, especially based on someone's looks and origins, when I view the world around me.  I do not love the idea that I am probably often stereotyped as a white male at a prestigious university, but I am very privileged with the fact that this stereotype does not really negatively affect me; while stereotypes of other people, like minorities, can unfortunately negatively affected them.

I think that non-negative stereotypes of a culture, such as Men"bro"za culture, or hacker culture, or West Coast culture, are not necessarily bad insofar as people acknowledge that not everyone in the group aligns with the stereotypes.   I think that groups can attempt to spread positive stereotypes about themselves.  A Manifesto serves this purpose in a way.  It can attest to the values a group strives to align to and live by; a group can unite under a stereotype.  I think that a Portrait is valuable insofar is it attests to the shared values and aspirations of a group.

On the morning of January 28, 1986, the *Challenger* space shuttle exploded over the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Cape Canaveral.  Roger Boisjoly knew exactly what had happened.

NASA had known that the O-ring seals on the rockets' fuel tanks were susceptible to fail in cold weather conditions.   It was just below freezing that morning in Cape Canaveral.  Boisjoly and his colleagues warned NASA that they should post-pone the launch of *Challenger* because of these cold conditions.  NASA dismissed the warnings, claiming that there was a large margin for the O-rings to not erode past the conditions they have been tested on, and that there were other O-rings as backups.

Engineer Allan McDonald heeded the warning and refused to sign to approval to launch to space shuttle, so his boss  Joe Kilminster signed the document instead. 

NASA was arguably unconvinced to heed the warnings because Boisjoly was unable to "quantify his concerns."  He knew there was probably going to be a problem but didn't have rigorous evidence.   This is actually very familiar of arguments I have heard made by people who think climate change concerns are over exaggerated.  Environmentalist have a hard time "quantifying" the effects of humans on the environment. This is food for thought - just because someone can't quantify the specifics of a problem does not mean at all that the problem does not exist.  There are problems that we might not be able to clearly see, but still exist.

The supposed unclear presentation of evidence of the O-ring problem by engineers prior to launch allowed NASA and engineers to go back and forth about who is to blame: NASA for not heeding the warning or engineers for not making the warning as loud and clear as they should have. No one was inevitably specifically blamed for the disaster.

NASA instructed its employees to not speak with reports about the explosion.  Ronald Reagan established a commission to investigate to disaster, and the engineers were not as quiet as NASA would have liked.  Boisjoly was the primary whistleblower.  Not only did he note that NASA was warned and did not heed the warning, he said that Thiokol engineers were not all unanimously behind the decision.  

My gut tells me Boisjoly was in the right.  A tragedy was had occurred, millions of dollars were wasted, and most importantly, lives were lost.  For NASA to not own up to its mistakes is very questionable.  I think the most ethical thing for NASA to do would have been to be honest and fire those who were responsible.  But maybe this is easier said than done, because it was arguably not entirely clear who was responsible. 

One could also make the argument that when companies or organizations deal with risk, accidents happen.  You can say that it is in the nature of NASA's line of work for a disaster like *Challenger* to happen.  The organization arguably had the right to protect the details of what went wrong as long as they promised to improve.  
The ethicality of Boisjoly's decisions is somewhat dependent on whether or not NASA and Thiokol had the right to hide the details of what went wrong.  I still think that if he was being investigate and this was weighing his conscience, there was no reason he should be expected to lie or hide things.  I think it was wrong that he was retaliated against and that his career was destroyed.  

There are definitely cases where the conscience of an organization or company a whole is not well formed on certain matters.  And when this happens, it is a on whistleblowers to protect stakeholders who will be negatively affected by the organization/company's decisions.  There are options to assess prior to whistleblowing, perhaps trying to talk to upper management, change people's minds, and create change within a company.  But if those do not work, I think whistleblowing is a strong weapon to create change.  This is especially true of you are being asked to lie or conceal things.  It may harm one's career and reputation, but I guess at the end of the day, when you look back on your life and your decisions, you want to know you did the right thing.

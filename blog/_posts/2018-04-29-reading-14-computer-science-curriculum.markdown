ABET’s [guidelines][abet] on the accreditation of a computer science curriculum is relatively open ended, but does cover a lot of ground. It does not list courses to be taken but does cover a variety of things I did not expect, such as the fact that students must be evaluated and advised. I believe that Notre Dame’s department and [requirements][nd] satisfy the criteria, but there probably is room for improvement.  

ACM has a [five-hundred page PDF][acm] discussing the criteria. There is an table showing how many lecture hours are to be spent on various topics on page 37 (according to the document, not the page counter).  By “core hour” the document seems to mean one hour of lecture, not credit hour.  And this hour of lecture is lecture time that is strictly spent discussing the topic.  If this understanding is right, Notre Dame probably covers most of its grounds.  There are Teir 1 required hours and Teir 2 hours that about 90% of should get covered (often through electives).  At Notre Dame, there is no way to guarantee electives do cover these, unless students had to take a “sort” of elective.  Regardless, a lot of these hours probably do get covered in core classes. 

Notre Dame will cover a lot of the hours without explicitly “covering” the hour, for example, we would talk about parallel computing in systems, and get some hours there, and again in OS, and get some hours there.  I did the math, at 50 minutes a class, three times a week (usually) and 15 weeks a year, we get to about 37 lecture hours for a class, assuming all the time in the class is spent lecturing.  With what looks like 17 computer science classes required by Notre Dame, it is very feasible to reach the required approximately 300 hours.  I do think some hours on some topics probably do fall through the cracks, or students miss out by not getting them taught in an explicit manner.  Also with things Notre Dame has us take, like Theory of Computing, I would say it is hard to pick where the 37 hours of what was discussed would fall, or even if they match non-full topics on the list.

The most hours are given to Software Development Fundamentals, at 43.  The tricky thing is wondering what in a class is something that would be put towards those 43 hours.

I think these are good guidelines, but they are mostly just guidelines.  It too hard to scientifically implement them.

When I interned last summer and was developing, I noticed that a lot of the other people did not study computer science in college.  They picked up coding on their own.  It is an interesting idea that the skills I earn from a four-year degree that was very expensive could be just as valuable as a far more affordable series of online classes (“bootcamps”) that could be completed in a few months.   

There are all the other aspects of a Notre Dame education, for example, we did not even learn about anything computer science until sophomore year.  Resulting from my degree, I also know a lot about Ancient Rome and Chemistry, for example. 

But is there added value specifically for computer science content by the nature of learning it at college and not online?  There will be people who say in learning in a classroom is irreplaceable.  I think doing group work, working through things with TAs or going to a professor’s office hours, these are methods of learning that sometimes are when you learn the most and gain a better understanding of something fundamental.  The question could be that are these benefits worth the money and the time of getting a degree in this way? That question could also be revised because there are much cheaper computer science programs, such as at your local state school, than Notre Dame’s.  That gets us to the is Notre Dame worth it argument, not is a computer science degree worth it argument. 

I would say that a lot of what I have learned and the way I have been shaped to think as a software developer has value that would be very hard to have earned online and that is probably not in these bootcamps.  Also during my internship I did maybe 90% of my work with languages we did not get to at Notre Dame.  But because of Notre Dame, I was able to learn these incredibly quickly, and solve problems well.  I shortened the runtime of one thing I was working on from 40 seconds to 1 second because I was indexing something and realized its much more efficient to traverse it like a linked list.  I do not think a bootcamp could have taught me to think like that.

I do not believe a college degree is required to be to be a good computer scientist, computer engineer, software developer, or programmer.  It is a means of getting there, and I would argue most of the time it results in a better computer scientist, computer engineer, software developer, or programmer.  But a lot genuine effort to learn outside of class can definitely make someone better than someone else who got a degree.

I feel pretty prepared for my future career because of Notre Dame.  I think there is so much to know so it’s hard to say if I know everything I should know, but I certainly know enough to have a solid base.
